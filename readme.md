# Sleep Disorders and Quality of Life

This is a Python analysis of a mock dataset, based on a real dataset from Kaggle.
The mock dataset was created by feeding the Kaggle dataset into Mockaroo and using
Two separate schemas to generate APIs that we can call via Requests.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to show the data analysis practices using Python and
applicable libraries. 

For this project, we will look at mock patient data that comprises patients with and without sleep disorders. 

This project will show a high-level understanding of:
1. Data Discovery. This is where we want to describe the dataset to get a better understanding of data cleaning needs,
and possible obstacles, and it allows us to formulate questions we can pose for analysis. 
2. Data Cleaning. The process of removing missing/unneeded records, and adding in better organized or useful data. 
3. Data Analysis. The process of grouping and aggregating data to answer questions about our data set. 
4. Data Visualization. Seeing a user-friendly representation of the data set, as well as analysis questions in graphs, tables, plots, etc. 

## Setup instructions
1. Fork the repo and clone the forked repo to your machine.
2. Open Gitbash in Windows or Terminal in Mac and navigate to the project folder.
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:  Commands for activating virtual env on git bash
3a. python -m venv venv
3b. cd venv, then cd Script 
3c. . activate   (run this command to activate venv and change the directory back to the project folder when finished)
4. Once the virtual environment is activated, run pip install -r requirements.txt 
5. Once Jupyter Notebook is installed, run the command Jupyter Notebook
6. When Jupyter Notebook opens, navigate to the project folder and open the notebook, with the filename ending in ipynb
7. Select run > run all from the menu at the top
8. The project notebook is ready to interact with
